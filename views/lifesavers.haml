%h2 the truth about men
%p A college professor was doing a study testing the senses of firstgraders, using a bowl of lifesavers. He gave all the children the same kind of lifesavers, one at a time, and asked them to identify them by color and flavor. The children began to say: "Red............cherry," "Yellow.........lemon," "Green..........lime," "Orange..........orange." Finally the professor gave them all honey-flavored lifesavers. After eating them for a few moments none of the children could identify the taste. "Well," he said "I'll give you all a clue, It's what your mother may sometimes call your father." One little girl looked up in horror, spit her lifesaver out and yelled: "Oh My God!!!! They're assholes!"
