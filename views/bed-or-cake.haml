%h1 Which would you choose: cake or bed?
%p A husband is at home watching a football game when his wife interrupts, "Honey, could you fix the light in the hallway? It's been flickering for weeks now." He looks at her and says angrily, "Fix the lights now? Does it look like I have GE written on my forehead? I don't think so."
%p "Fine," then the wife asks, "Well then, could you fix the fridge door? It won't close right." To which he replied, "Fix the fridge door? Does it look like I have Westinghouse written on my forehead? I don't think so."
%p "Fine," she says, "Then you could at least fix the steps to the front door? They are about to break." "I'm not a damn carpenter and I don't want to fix steps." He says, "Does it look like I have ACE hardware written on my forehead? I don't think so. I've had enough of you. I'm going to the bar!"
%p So he goes to the bar and drinks for a couple of hours. He starts to feel guilty about how he treated his wife, and decides to go home. As he walks into the house he notices that the steps are already fixed. As he enters the house, he sees the hall light is working. As he goes to get a beer, he notices the fridge door is fixed.
%p "Honey," he asks, "How'd all this get fixed?"
%p She said, "Well, when you left I sat outside and cried. Just then a nice young man asked me what was wrong, and I told him. He offered to do all the repairs, and all I had to do was either go to bed with him or bake a cake."
%p He said, "So what kind of cake did you bake?" She replied, "Hellooooo... Do you see Betty Crocker written on my forehead? I don't think so!"
